These are the commands that AutoMod accepts. A command is triggered by posting a message containing a prefix (by default `/`) followed by the command's name in a location AutoMod can access.

For example, you can run `/test` in a server with AutoMod and you should get a response.

This documentation site offers a detailed explanation of each available command. If you ever need a refresher, then you can come back here or use `/help`.

AutoMod's commands are split into four catgeories. These are:

- **[Moderation](/docs/commands/moderation)** \
   Commands for enforcing server rules.

- **[Configuration](/docs/commands/configuration)** \
   Commands for setting up and customizing settings.

- **[Owner](/docs/commands/owner)** \
   Exclusive commands for the bot owner to manage and control AutoMod.

- **[Miscellaneous](/docs/commands/miscellaneous)** \
   Additional commands not covered by other categories.
