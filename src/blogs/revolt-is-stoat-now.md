As of publication today, Revolt has rebranded to Stoat, after the exceedingly cute mustelid native to Eurasia and northern North America. You might have noticed most of the references to Revolt across the AutoMod site have already switched over.

The sudden rebrand was spurred by a cease and desist letter, hence the somewhat hastily concocted shambles. You can read [the full post on the Stoat blog](https://stoat.chat/updates/long-live-stoat) with further details.

If you're wondering what this means for AutoMod and other bots under the AutoMod umbrella going forward, don't be worried. AutoMod isn't going anywhere and will continue to be hosted and developed as it has been.

In the days following the rebrand and publication of this post, you might encounter some service degradation of AutoMod as things are updated and moved over. Please be aware this is temporary and largely a result of upstream changes being made by the Stoat team.

Most bot features and functionality will continue to work and operate exactly as they have in the past. If there are any major changes, you'll be the first to know.

Things will certainly be shaky, but we'll work through it. If you have any questions, feel welcome to swing by the [AutoMod Stoat server](http://stt.gg/automod), and I'll do my best to assist you.

Thanks for sticking with us as I work through this.
