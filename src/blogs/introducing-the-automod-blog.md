Welcome to the first instalment of the AutoMod blog -- or, if you will, AutoBlog. You won't? Well, that's too bad.

This blog will provide an opportunity to publish notes, updates, and reflections on the ongoing development of AutoMod. The intent is to allow communities to remain up-to-date with all things under the AutoMod umbrella at their own pace and in the form they choose.

You can expect all sorts of stuff here. It'll serve as a changelog (a changeblog, if you will) detailing both new features and alterations to existing ones, as well as a place to document development miscellany such as engineering challenges and interesting observations.

While posts will be polished, they'll also be a tad informal and honest. The goal isn't generic PR speak but instead genuine and interesting updates that you'll hopefully be able to take something away from. Transparency is the goal.

Posts will vary in both length and frequency, with new ones being released only when there is something to say -- no filler here!
