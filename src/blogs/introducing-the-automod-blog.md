Welcome to the first instalment of the AutoMod blog -- or, if you will, AutoBlog. You won't? Well, that's too bad.

This blog will provide an opportunity to publish notes, updates, and reflections on the ongoing development of AutoMod. The intent is to allow communities to remain up-to-date with all things under the AutoMod umbrella at their own pace and in the form they choose.

You can expect all sorts of stuff here. It'll serve as a changelog -- a changeblog, if you might so humour me -- detailing both new features and alterations to existing ones, as well as a place to document development miscellany such as engineering challenges and interesting observations.

Previously, musings like this have been announcements or discussions in the AutoMod Revolt server. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but does come with some disadvantages that this blog alleviates.

Revolt messages are limited in character count, difficult to syndicate, and locked behind a Revolt login. They're also inaccessible to users who are banned from the AutoMod Revolt server, which is inconvenient for those who are still allowed to use the bot but can't access the server.

One of the goals of this blog is to make any technical posts accessible for non-technical folks. That isn't to say that technical posts will be lessened to the lowest common denominator, just that, where possible, they'll be written in such a way that everyone can benefit from them -- not just the nerds.

While posts will be polished, they'll also be a tad informal and honest. The goal isn't generic PR speak but instead genuine and interesting updates that you'll hopefully be able to take something away from. Transparency is the intent.

Posts will vary in both length and frequency, with new ones being released only when there is something to say -- no filler here!
