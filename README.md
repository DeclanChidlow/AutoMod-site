AutoMod is [Stoat's](https://stoat.chat) premier moderation bot, featuring logging, filtering, utilities, anti-spam, comprehensive documentation, and much more. It aims to provide an easy way to protect your communities from malicious actors.

This is the website for the bot that provides documentation and information about it. The site is built using the [Origami programming language](https://weborigami.org).

Currently, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. To simplify deployment, a GitHub action is setup which will build and deploy the site from [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/AutoMod-site/tree/gh-pages).
